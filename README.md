# python-port-scanner
First cyber security project, I created a basic port scanner with use of threading
It scans a target IP or domain for open TCP ports within a specified range.

Features:

- Displays the open ports in real time
- User input for target and the port range
- Fast scanning due to the use of threading
- Handles domain name resolution
- Prints message if no open ports found

Usage:

- Clone the repository or download the script
- Run the script
- Enter the target IP or domain name
- Enter the start and end port numbers to scan
- View the open ports detected

IMPORTANT:

- ONLY SCAN HOSTS YOU HAVE PERMISSION TO SCAN OR OWN.
- UNAUTHORIZED SCANNING MAY BE ILLEGAL OR VIOLATE TOS.
