# python-port-scanner
First cyber security project, I created a basic port scanner with use of threading
It scans a target IP or domain for open TCP ports within a specified range.

Features:

- Displays the open ports in real time
- User input for target and the port range
- Fast scanning due to the use of threading
- Handles domain name resolution
- Prints message if no open ports found

Usage:
1.Clone the repository or download the script,
  2. Run the script,
  3. Enter the target IP or domain name,
  4.Enter the start and end port numbers to scan,
  5.View the open ports detected.
